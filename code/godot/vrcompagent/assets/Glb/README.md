# Avatar GLB Drop Zone

Place personal or licensed avatar `.glb` files in this folder on your local machine.

- Files stored here are ignored by Git (`code/godot/vrcompagent/assets/Glb/**`).
- Keep your private or purchased avatars out of the public repository.
- Godot scenes referencing `res://assets/Glb/<name>.glb` will still load locally.

When sharing the project, instruct collaborators to copy their own avatars into this directory.
