# VRM Sample Drop Zone

Store personal or licensed `.vrm` characters locally in this folder.

- Git ignores `vrm_samples/**/*.vrm` to keep private avatars out of the public repo.
- Provide only lightweight placeholders (like this README) in source control.
- When running the project, copy any required VRM files here so Godot can load them from `res://vrm_samples/`.
